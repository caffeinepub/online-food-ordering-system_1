  "summary": "Diff implements a 4-step customer ordering flow with an in-memory cart, delivery details form, and automatic order-status progression, plus updates to Footer text and About page primary description. Potential gaps remain around About page “no extra claims” wording and Step 4 guard/message behavior due to truncated evidence.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-21",
      "requirement": "Update the About Project page copy to match the user-provided text exactly (English), without adding extra claims.",
      "reason": "While the provided sentence appears as the primary description, the page also includes additional feature/overview copy that adds claims beyond the exact user-provided text (e.g., “comprehensive ... demonstration”, “complete ... workflow”, “Real-time order tracking”), which may violate the “without adding extra claims” constraint.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/AboutProject.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-19",
      "requirement": "If the user has not placed an order in the current session, Step 4 should not be reachable through the normal flow; if it is reached (e.g., via refresh), show a clear English message indicating there is no active order to track.",
      "reason": "A guard helper exists (canAccessStep4) in the new flow hook, but the provided/truncated CustomerPortal diff does not show Step 4 being conditionally blocked nor the required “no active order” message when tracking is not active.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/hooks/useCustomerOrderFlow.ts",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Footer includes additional caffeine.ai attribution link and “Built with ♥” line beyond the two required footer lines.",
      "reason": "REQ-22 only requests inclusion of two specific lines; the diff adds extra branding/attribution not requested.",
