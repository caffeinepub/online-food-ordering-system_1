  "summary": "Implemented a new DishImageModal component and updated CustomerPortal menu items to reference local image paths and open a modal on image click. However, the diff summary does not show the required static image asset files being added to the frontend, so the “real dish images (static assets)” requirement is not fully evidenced as completed.",

      "requirement": "Add real dish images (static assets) for each sample menu item in the Customer Portal menu (Pizza, Burger, Biryani, Pasta, Sandwich, Noodles), stored and served from the frontend.",
      "reason": "CustomerPortal.tsx references image paths under /assets/generated/*.png, but the diff summary shows no added image files or asset-directory changes, so there is no evidence the six required static image assets were actually added to the repo and will be served locally.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/CustomerPortal.tsx (image paths reference /assets/generated/dish-*.dim_512x512.png)",
